			<p>It was no secret that in 2017 Sauber was the worst team on the Formula 1 grid. With below-average cars and a duo of drivers, the swede Marcus Ericsson and the German Pascal Wehrlein, who was nearly as famous as Renault's Jolyon Palmer (who was fired before the completion of the 2017 season) for how many times he crashed his car. Things looked pretty bleak for the struggling team. But then it was announced they would be recieving Charles Leclerc for the 2018 season and again there was hope. Leclerc had proven to be a top-notch driver in F2, the final peg of the FIA Global Pathway (See: FIA Global Pathway), having driven just one season - the 2017 season. Leclerc netted 7 wins in 22 starts for Prema Racing, alongside 9 podiums and 8 poles. He would go on to win the 2017 F2 championship as a rookie, a feat only accomplished by two other drivers: Renault's Nico Hulkenburg in 2009, and 5 time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton. Immediately upon Charles Leclerc's arrival he was expected to elevate the struggling Sauber team. Alongside his signing also came news of a huge sponsorship deal with Alfa Romeo, which saw the team rebranded as Alfa Romeo Sauber. Even though they are sponsored by Sauber they still run Ferrari engines. However come Australia things still seemed to be amiss for the Sauber team. Charles Leclerc only managed a P13 finish, 3 spots out of the points, and that was aided by the retirement of 5 different cars, including his teammate Marcus Ericsson. Things improved as the Sauber duo advanced to Bahrain, which saw Marcus Ericsson finish 9th to claim his first points in 49 races. Leclerc managed a P12 finish. The Chinese Grand Prix proved much, much worse. The Sauber duo struggled greatly, with Leclerc only finishing 19th, ahead of Brendon Hartley's Toro Rosso, who retired from the race. Marcus Ericsson finished 17th, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean splitting the two up at the back of the grid. But then the Azerbaijan Grand Prix happened, and Charles Leclerc shocked the F1 world. Charles Leclerc drove the, as proven so far, struggling Sauber team to a 6th place finish; 1 spot above the line usually drawn by the top 3 teams; Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull. The race also saw another major shock in Force India's Sergio Perez taking a podium finish in third place. The 6th place finish for Charles Leclerc was a huge confidence boost for both Alfa Romeo Sauber, and Leclerc himself. When it was time for the Spanish Grand Prix Leclerc took points again, driving the Sauber team to a 10th place finish. Monaco, Leclerc's home race, proved catastrophic. At the highest speed portion of the track, heading into the infamous Monaco Chicane, Leclerc's left-front brake failed on his Sauber. He did his best to avoid the other competitiors, but there was nothing that could be done to avoid an impact with Brendon Hartley. Leclerc's Sauber impacted the Toro Rosso's rear wing and flew over the back of his car, landing on its wheels and skidding into a run-off area (See: Charles Leclerc Monaco Crash). Leclerc was alright, and the team move on to next week; the Canadian Grand Prix. Leclerc again took points, with another P10 finish. The French Grand Prix saw Leclerc's 3rd P10 of the season, and 2nd P10 in a row. The following race in Austria saw Leclerc improve to a 9th place finish and claim 2 points, with his teammate Marcus Ericsson right behind in 10th to claim 1 point; a rare double points finish for the Sauber team. The British Grand Prix, however, was disaterous for the Sauber team. Leclerc was running strong again, but an improperly secured wheel on the pit stop forced him to retire from the race. Marcus Ericsson later crashed hard, and he too retired from the race. Leclerc had issues at the German Grand Prix as well, the team deciding to switch to wet tires in anticitpation of heavier rain; however the rain never came. They lost all of their track position and Leclerc was rendered unable to recover. His teammate Ericsson, however, did finish 9th to claim two points on the day. Hungary saw, yet again, more issues for the Sauber team. Charles Leclerc's engine expired on lap one, leaving him unable to complete the race. Marcus Ericsson had lap one, turn one contact with Daniel Ricciardo
