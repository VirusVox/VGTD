			<p>It was no secret that in 2017 Sauber was the worst team on the Formula 1 grid. With below-average cars and a duo of drivers, the swede Marcus Ericsson and the German Pascal Wehrlein, who was nearly as famous as Renault's Jolyon Palmer (who was fired before the completion of the 2017 season) for how many times he crashed his car. Things looked pretty bleak for the struggling team. But then it was announced they would be recieving Charles Leclerc for the 2018 season and again there was hope. Leclerc had proven to be a top-notch driver in F2, the final peg of the FIA Global Pathway (See: FIA Global Pathway), having driven just one season - the 2017 season. Leclerc netted 7 wins in 22 starts for Prema Racing, alongside 9 podiums and 8 poles. He would go on to win the 2017 F2 championship as a rookie, a feat only accomplished by two other drivers: Renault's Nico Hulkenburg in 2009, and 5 time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton. Immediately upon Charles Leclerc's arrival he was expected to elevate the struggling Sauber team. Alongside his signing also came news of a huge sponsorship deal with Alfa Romeo, which saw the team rebranded as Alfa Romeo Sauber. Even though they are sponsored by Alfa Romeo they still run Ferrari engines. However come Australia things still seemed to be amiss for the Sauber team. Charles Leclerc only managed a P13 finish, 3 spots out of the points, and that was aided by the retirement of 5 different cars, including his teammate Marcus Ericsson. Things improved as the Sauber duo advanced to Bahrain, which saw Marcus Ericsson finish 9th to claim his first points in 49 races. Leclerc managed a P12 finish. The Chinese Grand Prix proved much, much worse. The Sauber duo struggled greatly, with Leclerc only finishing 19th, ahead of Brendon Hartley's Toro Rosso, who retired from the race. Marcus Ericsson finished 17th, with Frenchman Romain Grosjean splitting the two up at the back of the grid. But then the Azerbaijan Grand Prix happened, and Charles Leclerc shocked the F1 world. Charles Leclerc drove the, as proven so far, struggling Sauber team to a 6th place finish; 1 spot above the line usually drawn by the top 3 teams; Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull. The race also saw another major shock in Force India's Sergio Perez taking a podium finish in third place. The 6th place finish for Charles Leclerc was a huge confidence boost for both Alfa Romeo Sauber, and Leclerc himself. When it was time for the Spanish Grand Prix Leclerc took points again, driving the Sauber team to a 10th place finish. Monaco, Leclerc's home race, proved catastrophic. At the highest speed portion of the track, heading into the infamous Monaco Chicane, Leclerc's left-front brake failed on his Sauber. He did his best to avoid the other competitiors, but there was nothing that could be done to avoid an impact with Brendon Hartley. Leclerc's Sauber impacted the Toro Rosso's rear wing and flew over the back of his car, landing on its wheels and skidding into a run-off area (See: Charles Leclerc Monaco Crash). Leclerc was alright, and the team move on to next week; the Canadian Grand Prix. Leclerc again took points, with another P10 finish. The French Grand Prix saw Leclerc's 3rd P10 of the season, and 2nd P10 in a row. The following race in Austria saw Leclerc improve to a 9th place finish and claim 2 points, with his teammate Marcus Ericsson right behind in 10th to claim 1 point; a rare double points finish for the Sauber team. The British Grand Prix, however, was disaterous for the Sauber team. Leclerc was running strong again, but an improperly secured wheel on the pit stop forced him to retire from the race. Marcus Ericsson later crashed hard, and he too retired from the race. Leclerc had issues at the German Grand Prix as well, the team deciding to switch to wet tires in anticitpation of heavier rain; however the rain never came. They lost all of their track position and Leclerc was rendered unable to recover. His teammate Ericsson, however, did finish 9th to claim two points on the day. Hungary saw, yet again, more issues for the Sauber team. Charles Leclerc's engine expired on lap one, leaving him unable to complete the race. Marcus Ericsson had lap one, turn one contact with Daniel Ricciardo wgucg saw him drop all the way down to P15. The Belgian Grand Prix at the legendary Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps saw Charles Leclerc involved in a freak turn one, lap one crash, Renault's Nico Hulkenburg locked up his brakes entering turn one and collided with the back of McLaren's Fernando Alonso. Alonso's car then spun into the back of Leclerc's Sauber and popped up over the top of it, crashing down on the driver compartment and totally destroying the Sauber (See: Spa Turn One Crash). If it had not been for the halo, a safety measure designed to prevent pieces of debris from contacting a drivers' helmet, Charles Leclerc would have been hurt, and potentially even killed. This is confirmed by the damage done to Leclerc's halo after the crash: the halo was destroyed, it had been hit by the underside of Fernando Alonso's car as it popped up over the back of his Sauber. For the second race in a row the Italian Grand Prix saw a Sauber driver suffer a horrific crash. During practice Marcus Ericsson sailed off toward the highest speed corner on the track, his DRS - Drag Reduction System, a system designed to help drivers pass another on straightaways by opening a flap on the rear wing - wide open per the normal. Yet upon touching the brakes, which is supposed to close the DRS instantaneously, his DRS remained open. As he turned into the corner the car crashed hard, spinning into a guard rail and rolling 3 times. Ericsson walked away fine, and Sauber immediately turned their attention to Charles Leclerc's car. It was a good thing they did. Leclerc, who wasn't too far behind Ericsson and had slowed for the caution, had the exact same issue upon closer inspection. The team brought Charles to the pit lane and the team went to work fixing the car. However in the race the Sauber team still struggled with issues, Leclerc finishing P11. The Singapore Grand Prix rolled around and Sauber looked to be back in the running. Leclerc came home P9, taking two points for the Sauber team. The following race in Russia Leclerc shone yet again, taking P7, the position dubbed 'Best of the Rest', and taking 6 points for his troubles. Japan, however, saw the return of issues with Leclerc having lap 5 contact with Haas' Kevin Magnussen. Leclerc charged back to P9, however a mechanical issued forced him to retire from the race. The United States Grand Prix saw more issues with Leclerc being hit by Romain Grosjean on lap one. Leclerc soldiered on until it was evident the car was too hurt, and the Sauber team asked him to retire from the race. However the Mexican Grand Prix again saw the return of the brilliance of Charles Leclerc, who managed to finish P7, again best of the rest. He then backed that result up the following week in Brazil with another P7, best of the rest finish. With just one race remaining in the season, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Leclerc sits 14th in points, a stellar effort for the Sauber team. However amidst all of the news of the season is the most important news of them all. It was announced that Charles Leclerc would move up to Ferrari, swapping seats with Kimi Raikkonen for the 2019 season. Much, much more is expected of Charles Leclerc come 2019, now that he will be in a car well capable of winning races week in and week out. As Leclerc said about the signing: <h2><q>It's something very special, the red car is always special. Since [I was] a child, I have always lookad at it more than any other car and it will be a dream for me... but it's still a long way to go.</q></h2><img src="https://www.sauberf1team.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Charles-Hero-Shot.jpg" alt="Charles Leclerc">You can read more about Charles Leclerc's Ferrari signing by following the link at the side of the page.</p>
